    <string name="pomodoro_title">The Pomodoro Technique</string>
    <string name="pomodoro_info">Invented by the Italian Francesco Cirillo, the Pomodoro Technique works by having a person work for 25 to 30 minute periods and then take breaks of 2-3 minutes. After four such sessions, the person takes a longer break. Having 25 minute work periods allows one to get some work done without feeling overwhelmed or burnt out. Of course, the exact number of minutes for the work time and break time will vary per person.</string>
